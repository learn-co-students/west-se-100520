# Find the Mean of all Digits

Create a function that returns the mean of all digits.

- Examples
```
mean(42) ➞ 3

mean(12345) ➞ 3

mean(666) ➞ 6

```
## Notes
The mean of all digits is the sum of digits / how many digits there are (e.g. mean of digits in 512 is (5+1+2)/3(number of digits) = 8/3=2).
The mean will always be a integer.
