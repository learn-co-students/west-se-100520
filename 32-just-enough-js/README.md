Go to your favorite websites and modify the DOM programmatically. Wikipedia and Twitter are good examples. 

- Select elements and save them to variables
- Delete at least 2 elements
- Modify elements (e.g., replace image url, change text, change CSS)
- Create new elements and add to page

- Think programmatically about the DOM; use iteration and multiple CSS selectors

    - Change all instances of one word
    - Replace all images on only a certain portion of the DOM
    - Change every other header
    - Bonus (Hard): replace all elements of one tag to another (e.g., p to h1)
